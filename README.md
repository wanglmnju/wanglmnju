## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A research data scientist with a Ph.D. in physics. In recent years, I have focused on Machine Learning applications to solve challenging problems. My preferred programming languages are Python and SQL. I have 5 years of experience in Python and 2 years of experience in SQL.  Iâ€™m very familiar with ML skills such as Sci-Kit Learn, Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy, Streamlit, Flask, Git, etc. I have 2 years of experience in cloud calculations, like AWS. I am a certified AWS developer associate and solution architect associate.
